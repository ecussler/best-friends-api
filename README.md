# Best-Friends-API [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
  
  ## Description
  The Best-Friends-API is a social media back-end using MongooseDB. As a NoSQL, the MoongooseDB allows for more fluid relationships between models and collections, making it a great option for social media sites. The technologies used in the application are:

  - MongooseDB
  - MongoDB
  - Node.js
  - Express.js

  I attempted to make the seeds a clever process but was not able to get it running in a reasonable time-block. I manually entered the data displayed in the demo video.
